# Legends & Legacies

## Description

This project is maintained and developed by [John Larson (W5DEV)](github.com/W5DEV). Please contact me via my website at [W5DEV.com](https://w5dev.com) for any questions or concerns, or issues with this project.

Legends & Legacies is a text-based role-playing game that allows the player to create a character and explore a world filled with adventure, danger, and mystery. The player will be able to make choices that will affect the outcome of the story, and will have to use their wits and skills to survive in a world where danger lurks around every corner.

This game is currently in the engine/rules development phase. The game is being developed in Python, and will be loosely based on rules commonly found in popular RPG games.

Any contributions are welcome, and can be made by forking the repository and submitting a pull request. It should also be noted that while in the engine/rules development phase, the code can and will be constantly changed and refactored as improvements and optimizations are made.

The project development is being broken up in phases:

- Phase 1: Character Creation
- Phase 2: Storytelling
- Phase 3: Combat
- Phase 4: Leveling Up
- Phase 5: Testing
- Phase 6: UI Implementation
- Phase 7: Modularity and Customization

Each phase will be broken down into smaller tasks, which will be tracked in the project board. To see the current status of the project, please visit the [Official Legends and Legacies Asana Board](https://app.asana.com/0/1207330598140022/1207330707711688)

Current phase ***Phase 1: Character Creation***.

## Features

- Character Creation: The player will be able to create their own character, choosing from a variety of classes, races and abilities.

- Compelling Stories: The game features a rich and immersive story that will keep players engaged from start to finish.

## Current Status

Currently, the game is in the early stages of development, with the basic framework of character creation in place.
